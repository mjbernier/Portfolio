# SQL Programming

This project contains a sample of my work in SQL programming. While currently small, I intend to add more code over time.

The current content includes examples of:
- Basic table operations
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Inline Table Functions
- Pivot Tables

Language: Microsoft T-SQL (Transact-SQL)

Environment: 
- Microsoft SQL Server 2019 Developer Edition
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) v19.1

Dataset: Annual Crop and Livestock Production and Yields by Country and Region, 1961-2021

Source: Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, https://fao.org/faostat/

Note: This dataset is provided in MS SQL Server Backup (.bak) format. It has been compressed into a ZIP file to fit within GitHub's 25Mb file size limit.
