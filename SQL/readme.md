# SQL Programming

This project contains a sample of my work in SQL programming. While currently small, I will be adding to it over time.

Language: Microsoft T-SQL (Transaction SQL)

Environment: 
- Microsoft SQL Server 2019 Developer Edition
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) v19.1

Dataset: Annual Crop and Livestock Production and Yields by Country and Region, 1961-2021

Source: Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, https://fao.org/faostat/

Note: This dataset is provided in the form of a MS SQL Server Backup (.bak) file. Due to size, it has been compressed into a ZIP file.
