# Cornell Data Analytics

I attended and completed a certificate course in Data Analytics from Cornell University in 2018-2019. This course consisted of three classes:

- Understanding and Visualizing Data
- Implementing Scientific Decision Making
- Using Predictive Data Analysis

The instructor's preferred analytical tool for this course was Microsoft Excel. Each class required completion of a project and delivery of a formal project report to demonstrate mastery of the material. Students were instructed to independently develop their own business scenarios suitable to the goals of each class, and to perform appropriate research to acquire the necessary data. I created a fictional pizza restaurant located next to the campus of a fictional large Midwestern university with a successful men's basketball program, and used that relationship to develop the scenarios used for each project.

This project folder contains the final project reports and Excel worksheets from each of the three classes in the course.
