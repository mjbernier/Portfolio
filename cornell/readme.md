# Cornell Data Analytics

I took a certificate course in Data Analytics from Cornell University in 2018-2019. This project folder contains reports and data from each of the three classes in the course.

Students were allowed to develop their own business scenarios to use for each project. I created a fictional pizza restaurant located next to the campus of a large Midwestern university that was well known for their successful men's basketball program. Each course  examined a different aspect of data analytics as follows:

- Understanding and Visualizing Data
- Implementing Scientific Decision Making
- Using Predictive Data Analysis
