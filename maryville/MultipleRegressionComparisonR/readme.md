# Multiple Regression Model Comparison Using R

This was the final project in a Predictive Modeling course. The purpose of this project was to compare three types of predictive models to determine which is the best model to use in predicting insurance changes for a large corporation. The three models compared were:
  - Multiple Linear Regression
  - Regression Tree
  - Random Forest

In addition, a K-means cluster exercise was included to demonstrate another aspect of modeling, although it did not contribute to the end goal of the project.

Language - R

Environment - R Studio / Windows

Dataset - An insurance premium dataset hosted on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/simranjain17/insurance) that contains details on insurance premiumns based on several factors (age, gender, BMI, etc.).
