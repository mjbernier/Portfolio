# Predictive Modeling - PySpark

This was the final project in a course on Big Data Analytics, which focused on developing applications for analyzing very large datasets in a clustered computing environment.

The goal of this project was to analyze known forest cover types and determine the best of two models (Linear Regression or Decision Trees) for predicting the cover type of an unknown area.

Language: PySpark

Computing Environment: Databricks

Dataset: The Forest Cover dataset published on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/forest-cover-type-dataset) which contains observations of forest cover in 30 x 30 meter squares
over four areas of the Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado. (due to size this dataset is not attached)
