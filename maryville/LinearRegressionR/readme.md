# Linear Regression and Data Visualization in R

This was the final project in a R programming course. The goals of this project were threefold:
  - Demonstrate various types of statistical analysis
  - Create visualizations of analysis results using ggplot
  - Demonstrate the use of two separate models (multiple linear regression and K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithms) to determine the ability of each to accurately forecast the outcome of a given set of mechanical conditions.

Language - R

Computing Environment - R Studio / Windows

Dataset - The pmsm_temperature_data dataset hosted on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dearsijie/pmsm-temperature-data) which contains sensor data collected from a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM).
