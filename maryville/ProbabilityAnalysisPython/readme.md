# Probability Analysis using Python

This project was an assignment in a Python programming course which has several components:

- Create a Stock Simulation function
- Create an Annual Yield function to analyze the results of the Stock Simulation through multiple iterations
- Explore how function seeds affect the final outcome
- Build a Monte Carlo Simulation and use it for several probability analyses:
    - Analyze the effects of Volatility on Yield
    - Probability of performace when comparing two stocks
    - Calculating an expected Call Payoff for a stock

Language: Python

Environment: Anaconda / Jupyter Notebook

Dataset: None; sample values are inserted into the code before running
