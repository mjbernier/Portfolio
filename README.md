# Portfolio
This repository contains a portfolio of my work in Data Analytics and Data Science, showcasing both my
education and on the job skills in a variety of technical areas, including

  - Excel workbooks
  - Power BI data modeling and visualizations
  - R and Python programming projects including linear regressions and other predictive models
  - SQL programming
  - SAS programming
  - Formal presentation/report writing and delivery

This portfolio will grow and change over time as I work through my extensive collection of works. The
initial entries are from coursework as I pursued different educational credentials:
  - Certificate in Data Analytics from Cornell University (2018-2019)
  - BS in Data Science from Maryville University of Saint Louis (2020-2022)

Later additions to this portfolio will more deeply explore other related areas to demonstrate the breadth
of my skills across a long storied career in the IT field. In all cases there will be introductory postings
to provide background into each of these works, and source codes and datasets used when it is practical to
include them.
