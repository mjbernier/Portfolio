# Portfolio
This repository contains samples of my development work in Data Science and Data Analytics, showcasing both my education and
on the job skills in a variety of areas, including

  - Excel workbooks
  - Power BI data modeling and visualizations
  - R and Python programming projects including linear regressions and other predictive models
  - SQL programming
  - SAS programming

In some cases these samples were originally created during coursework while pursuing a BS in Data Science from Maryville
University of St. Louis during 2020-2022 (graduated magna cum laude 3.74/4.00 GPA). In other cases the samples reflect
development while on the job (due to the proprietary nature of my office work, data in some cases has been anonymized).
